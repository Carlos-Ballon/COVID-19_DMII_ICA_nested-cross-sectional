# Risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes - Nested Cross-Sectional

A nested cross-sectional study is a type of research design that combines elements of cross-sectional studies and cohort studies. In this design, a sample is taken from a larger cohort to perform a cross-sectional analysis at a specific point in time. This allows researchers to study the prevalence of a condition or characteristic in a subgroup of the cohort without the need to follow all participants over time.

This approach is useful because it provides detailed and specific data from a representative sample, reducing costs and time compared to a full cohort study. It also facilitates the comparison of different subgroups within the original cohort.
